  <h1 slot="intro">Accessibility</h1>
  <PageIntro slot="intro">What has been tested, and how?</PageIntro>

  <Note>
    <strong>This page is a work in progress</strong>. Eventually, it will detail
    what testing has been done, which tools and assistive technology were used,
    and list any known issues.
  </Note>

  <p>
    These components aim to be accessible to all users, whether they are using
    touch screens, keyboards, screen readers, or other assistive technology.
    ARIA is used when necessary to enhance the underlying HTML. Focus is managed
    where appropriate. The components have been tested with a variety of
    browsers and screen readers.
  </p>

  <Heading level={2} id="guarantee">Guaranteeâ€¦?</Heading>

  <p>
    In some regards the components offered here are akin to design system
    components. They are low-level pieces to a larger puzzle. The components
    themselves strive to offer the best possible accessible <em>baseline</em>.
    But beyond that, the guarantees that can be made regarding accessibility are
    limited. The way the components get used and combined can still lead to
    inaccessible outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are building more complex interfaces atop these components, you will
    need to test and evaluate accessibility yourself.
  </p>

  <Heading level={2}>Testing</Heading>

  <p>
    At a minimum testing will be done with the following browser and screen
    reader combinations
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Chrome + NVDA</li>
    <li>Chrome + JAWS</li>
    <li>Firefox + NVDA</li>
    <li>Safari + VoiceOver</li>
  </ul>

  <Heading level={2}>Known issues</Heading>

  <p>Coming soon (but hopefully not!)</p>
